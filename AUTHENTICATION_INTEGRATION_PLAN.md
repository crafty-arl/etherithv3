# Lean Agile Product Management Plan: Authentication Integration with Cloudflare Workers

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the integration of the Etherith authentication system with Cloudflare Workers deployment, focusing on secure session management across the edge network while maintaining the cultural heritage preservation use case. The plan follows lean startup principles with incremental delivery and validated learning cycles.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Platform**: Next.js application with dual authentication systems
- **Auth Providers**: 
  - NextAuth with Discord OAuth and Credentials providers
  - Custom AuthProvider with localStorage (demo/mock)
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with SQLite (local) and D1 (production)
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers via Wrangler
- **Storage**: IPFS integration via Pinata for decentralized content

### Key Findings
- Authentication system partially implemented with proper database schema
- D1 database binding configured but not fully connected
- Dual auth providers create complexity and potential conflicts
- Missing edge-compatible session management
- No secure token handling for Cloudflare Workers environment

## MVP Definition & Scope

### Problem Statement
Users need secure, persistent authentication across the Cloudflare edge network to access their cultural memory preservation features while maintaining optimal performance and security.

### Core Value Proposition
